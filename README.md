Check that the Dockerfile correctly installs Vue.js and Flask by:
1. Opening a Codespace
2. In bash, typing the command "npm vue --version" to check that Vue.js was installed (it should return a version number)
3. In bash, typing the command "python -m flask --version" to check that Flask was installed
